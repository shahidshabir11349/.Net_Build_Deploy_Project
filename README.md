# .Net Build and Deploy
# jenkins CI 
# Ansible CD 
# Windows IIS Web Hosting
# MSBuild

I have used Jenkins pipelines along with groovy scripts and Ansible Deployment Scripts. It can be used to Automate Build and Deploy on Three environments Development, Testing and Production. for each environment parmeters are set in jenkins file where respective values can be added. I have used these Pipline codes to Automate .Net Application Building using MSBuild, Test on Stagging Servers and Deployment on Server Using Ansible.
